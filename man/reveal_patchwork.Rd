\title{Reveal plots from a patchwork object}
\usage{
reveal_patchwork(pw, order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pw}{A patchwork object}

\item{order}{(optional) A numeric vector specifying in which order to reveal the plots

For example, if there are three plots in the patchwork, \code{order = c(3, 2, 1)} will invert the
order in which they are revealed.

Any plot not included in the vector will be omitted from the incremental
plots. E.g.: with \code{order = c(3, 1)}, the second plot is not shown.

By default, the first plot returned by this function is blank, showing layout elements
of the patchwork but none of its child plots. To omit the blank plot, include \code{-1}: e.g.
\code{order = c(-1, 3, 1)}, or \code{order = -1}.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot2 objects
}
\description{
Turns a \link[patchwork:patchwork-package]{patchwork} into a list of plots that reveal each child plot incrementally.
