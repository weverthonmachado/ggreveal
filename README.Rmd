`ggreveal` makes it easy to present data on ggplot2 graphs incrementally. The functions in this package take a plot and 
break it down into a series of intermediary plots that can be shown in sequence (e.g. in different slides). Like this:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, dpi=300}
gif
```

*Why* would you want to do that? Because it's fun — and often very useful in teaching and academic presentations. 


## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("weverthonmachado/ggreveal")
```

## Usage

Create a graph with ggplot2 as usual.

```r
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggreveal)

p <-  ggplot(penguins[!is.na(penguins$sex),],
             aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm,
                 group=sex, color=sex)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method="lm", formula = 'y ~ x', linewidth=1) +
      facet_wrap(~species) +
      theme_minimal()
p
```
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,  dpi=300}
p
```

Then use one of `reveal_panels()`, `reveal_groups()`, `reveal_layers()` or `reveal_axis()` to obtain a list of plots that show elements incrementally. 

```{r, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
plot_list <- reveal_groups(p)
plot_list
```

You probably want to save these graphs using `reveal_save()`, so you can easily include them later in a presentation:
```r
reveal_save(plot_list, "myplot.png", width = 8, height = 4)
```
```

✔ myplot_2_last.png
```

# <a id="why"></a> Wait, can't ggplot2 do this already?

Yes and no. `ggplot2` is composable by design, so it is straightforward to do some incremental reveal out of the box. For example, you can create the plot in steps and save the steps separately:

```r
data("mtcars")
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, 
            aes(mpg, wt)) +
     geom_point() 
     
p2 <- p1 + geom_smooth(method="lm", formula="y~x") 
```

The problem is: as you add layers and other elements, several visual aspects of the plot — e.g. range of axes, legends — can, and will often, change. Showing how the layout changes as you add elements is useful for teaching *how to make graphs in ggplot2*, but it is distracting when you want to focus on the *results*. Keeping the layout fixed is sometimes easy (e.g. set the `limits` argument for the x/y scale), but in many cases it requires tinkering with the internals of the ggplot object.
